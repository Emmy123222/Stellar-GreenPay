> Replace `OWNER` with your Expo account username. Add `EXPO_TOKEN` as a GitHub Actions repository secret (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions) before the first build.

- **Android**: APK (direct install, no Play Store needed)
- **iOS**: Simulator build (`.app` bundle, not a signed IPA)

## Shared API Client

The mobile app shares the API client logic with the web frontend. The API functions are located in `lib/api.ts` and are imported from the shared package.

## Wallet Integration

The app integrates with mobile Stellar wallets via deep links:
- Freighter Mobile: `freighter://tx?xdr=...`
- Other wallets can be added via similar deep link schemes

## Architecture

- **expo-router**: File-based routing
- **app/**: Screen components
- **lib/**: Shared utilities (API, Stellar SDK helpers)
- **components/**: Reusable UI components
- **styles/**: Theme and styling (matches web green theme)
